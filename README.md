Dan Hayes (dangular)
==================
My name is Dan Hayes (github.io/dangular) and I am a free lance web application developer and certified Java Enterprise Architect.  I specialize in helping companies building rich, single page web apps using angular.js, the ultra-hip client-side javascript SPA framework incubated by Google.  

Dangular is my personal github space where I will host personal projects, gists, etc.
