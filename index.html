    <section>

        <p>My name is Dan Hayes and I am a free lance software architect specializing in building dynamic, single page web
            applications based upon the <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a> Javascript SPA framework.  Angular.js
            offers a 2-way binding model, a dependency injection container, a modular architecture, and a rich set of built-in
            services that make writing large single page web applications manageable for even the most sophisticated enterprise
            applications.</p>

        <p>As an experienced <strong>Certified Java Enterprise Architect</strong>, I see Angular used in conjunction with server
            side Java technologies such as Spring running within Java Enterprise or Servlet containers.  For companies
            with huge investments in these infrastructures, this is a logical combination that can yield outstanding results.
            However, the most exciting developments are occurring in environments that have opened the door to application
            development based entirely upon the <em>MEAN Stack</em>.</p>

        <img src="images/mean.jpg" height="60"/>

        <p><em>MEAN</em>, which stands for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mongodb.org/">Mongo DB</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="http://expressjs.com">Express</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a>,
            and <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a>, is a compelling set of complimentary technologies
            that is challenging the traditional paradigms of web application development.  Based upon the Javascript programming
            language, the <em>MEAN</em> technologies work together to deliver a highly productive, event driven programming model
            that fully supports the construction of highly interactive web interfaces.  When combined with a responsive CSS layout
            library such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, the velocity of multi-device
            application development is taken to the next level.</p>

        <p>I am available for consulting opportunities on a full-time and part-time basis and equally comfortable in both
            <em>hybrid</em> (i.e. Angular + Java EE) or <em>100% Javascript</em> (MEAN) environments. I also have access
            to a network of highly qualified Angular and Java resources for larger project work.  If you would like to contact
            me further regarding professional opportunities, please reach out via
